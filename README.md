## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration of movie and ratings datasets
- TF-IDF vectorization of movie genres and titles
- Calculation of cosine similarity for content-based recommendations
- Collaborative filtering based on user rating patterns
- Visualization using word clouds for movie genres and titles
- Provides personalized movie suggestions to enhance user experience

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer, Cosine Similarity)
- WordCloud for data visualization

## How to Use
1. Load movie and ratings data
2. Preprocess data by handling missing values and extracting relevant features
3. Compute similarity matrices using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
4. Generate movie recommendations based on user preferences
5. Visualize trends and insights with word clouds and plots
